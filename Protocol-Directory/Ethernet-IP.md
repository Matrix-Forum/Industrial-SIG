## Brief

Ethernet/IP is a communication protocol used in industrial automation and control systems. It is based on the Ethernet protocol, which is widely used in computer networks, and provides a standardized way for devices to communicate with each other. Ethernet/IP is a client-server protocol where a client initiates communication with a server to read or write data. The protocol uses the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) as its application layer protocol, which provides a common object model for representing different types of data and systems. Ethernet/IP supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, and allows for the transfer of large amounts of data between devices. The protocol also supports real-time communication, enabling devices to exchange data in a time-critical manner. Ethernet/IP provides a variety of services for accessing and manipulating data, including device discovery, connection management, and data exchange. The protocol also supports secure communication through encryption and authentication, making it suitable for use in critical systems and applications. Ethernet/IP is widely used in industrial automation and control systems, including manufacturing, process control, and transportation systems. It is also used in building automation, energy management, and other applications where real-time communication and interoperability between different devices and systems are required.

## Use Cases
