## Brief

Modbus is a widely used serial communication protocol in the industrial automation and control systems (IACS) domain. It is used to establish communication between different devices such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), remote terminal units (RTUs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and other devices in a distributed control system. Modbus supports different communication protocols including RS-232, RS-485, and Ethernet TCP/IP. It uses a master/slave architecture where a master device initiates communication with one or more slave devices. The master device sends requests to the slave devices to read or write data, and the slave devices respond with the requested data. Modbus supports multiple data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, and allows for the transfer of large amounts of data between devices. It also supports different data transmission modes such as ASCII, RTU, and TCP. Modbus is a widely adopted protocol due to its simplicity, reliability, and interoperability with a variety of devices and systems. It has become a de facto standard in the industrial automation and control systems domain and is used in a variety of applications such as process control, building automation, energy management, and transportation systems.

## Use Cases

Process Control: Modbus is commonly used to exchange data between sensors, actuators, and control systems in process control applications. This allows for monitoring and control of different process variables such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, and level.

Energy Management: Modbus can be used to monitor and control energy usage in industrial settings. It can be used to gather data from different meters and energy management systems and allow for remote control and monitoring of energy usage.

Building Automation: Modbus is used in building automation systems (BAS) to monitor and control HVAC systems, lighting, access control, and other building systems. It allows for efficient energy usage, remote monitoring, and centralized control of different building systems.

Water and Wastewater Management: Modbus can be used in water and wastewater management systems to monitor and control different process variables such as flow rate, pressure, and pH levels. This helps in optimizing the water treatment process, reducing water usage, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Transportation Systems: Modbus can be used to control and monitor different components of transportation systems such as traffic signals, variable message signs, and other traffic management systems. It allows for efficient traffic management and improved safety on roads.
